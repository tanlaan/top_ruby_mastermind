# top_ruby_mastermind

## Assignment

Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.

## How to run

Run using `ruby mastermind.rb` and follow the prompts to play.

### Rules

Using numbers 1-6 you are guessing the code given by the computer. You will get feedback through B's and W's.
A `B` means that you have gotten a number correct and it is in the correct position.
A 'W' means that you have gotten a number correct, but it is not in the correct position.
Use deduction to figure out the code befor you run out of turns!
